spt.h
-----------------

- added variable MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE which thresholds clusters of pixels where acspo says cloud and spt says clear
- updated mask flags
- added prototypes: laplacian2, localmax2, and partial_derivative


spt.cc
------------------

- updated maskfronts function to follow the new mask flags
- removed overlay mask which is based on the amount of clear and cloud pixels in a window
- added code to remove clusters based on the average difference from the reference of the cluster, and the size of the cluster
- in connectfronts function, removed the last few lines that do a final dilation and thinning 
- fixed partial derivative function calls to fix backwards variable names

filter.cc
--------------

- added function partial_derivative which calculated dX and dY
- added function localmax2 with new calculations for localmax
- edited eigen mask to compute new residual mean across columns instead of rows
- increased window size in eigen_mask to 11x11
